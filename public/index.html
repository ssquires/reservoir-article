<div class="article-main">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;From 2012 to 2015, California was in a state of severe drought on par with the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014GL062433">worst periods in the past 1,200 years</a>. To get a sense of the extent of this damage, it helps to look at some numbers. In 2015 alone, the agriculture industry lost $1.84 billion in revenue due to the drought, totalling to <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/drought-costs-california-agriculture-184b-and-10100-jobs-2015/">$2.74 billion</a> across all economic sectors that year. This put more than <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/drought-costs-california-agriculture-184b-and-10100-jobs-2015/">10,000 seasonal laborers</a> out of work. Drought-related changes in ecology caused the coho salmon to face <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/calif-drought-could-wipe-out-southernmost-coho-salmon-group/">near-extinction</a>, and more than <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-sierra-tree-mortality-20161129-story.html">102 million trees</a> in the state died off. While this is far from a comprehensive list, it demonstrates how the effects of drought can spread through both the environment and the economy.</p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The impact of the drought was exacerbated by a fundamental limitation in our ability to predict water levels in reservoirs. Which reservoir will dry up first? How will the strain on that reservoir spread and affect nearby districts? Answering these sorts of questions would enable policy makers and water managers to mitigate the damage caused to California’s 40 million residents.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Though there will always be problems associated with drought, their societal cost can be significantly reduced if more accurate water-level predictions are available. To this end, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are developing data-driven statistical models of California’s reservoir system. This work could help California achieve a more resilient water infrastructure and predict the impact of drought on water reservoirs months beyond our best current efforts. </p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To understand the importance of their research, it is important to get an understanding of where California’s water comes from and how it is affected by drought.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;California’s water comes from two main sources, groundwater and surface water. Groundwater, such as wells and aquifers, accounts for 60% of the total supply. Surface water, stored by <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Water_in_California.html?id=0EUyvzGk53UC">1,530 reservoirs across the state</a>, accounts for the other 40%. Reservoirs are actively managed bodies of surface water that provide for agriculture, industry, power generation, and recreational needs. Though larger cities have diverse water resources such as multiple rivers and reservoirs, some smaller cities are limited to a single, local reservoir for water. While all reservoirs are affected by drought, not all are affected the same way.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The visualization below demonstrates the historical response of representative California reservoirs to a range of drought conditions. Try dragging the timeline slider to wet spells (blue regions) and dry spells (orange regions) to see how the reservoirs responded. You can also hover over a reservoir on the map to see which gauge it corresponds to.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Reservoirs constantly undergo significant fluctuations in fill level. This is due to variations in both inflow (from sources like precipitation) and outflow (for uses in agriculture and urban areas).</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Every day, water managers decide how much water to release, and must find a balance between meeting current demand and planning for the future. To do this, they must consider timescales ranging from daily human use to multi-year climate trends. This is already a complex task, and an unexpected drought can make reservoir exhaustion difficult to avoid. When a reservoir runs out of water, communities that depend on its supply experience immediate and serious consequences.</p>

    <p id="intro-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;In August 2014, the water level in Northern California’s Lake Shastina reservoir <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/20683/drought-stricken-california-town-struggles-to-keep-the-water-flowing">dropped to critical levels</a>. This resulted in serious water restrictions in the nearby town of Montague, affecting its 1,500 residents. Due to a shortage of water, each household in Montague was limited to 5,000 gallons of water a month, above which they would face a fine.</p>

    <p id="montague-wrapup">&emsp;&emsp;The average household could easily consume 5,000 gallons in a month, even if they restrict water use to their basic needs. A family of three or more would almost surely exceed the limit and end up paying fines. The story of Montague demonstrates that communities face consequences when a reservoir reaches critically low levels. If it were possible to predict a reservoir’s water level months in advance, we could potentially mitigate the risk of reservoir exhaustion. Unfortunately, predicting future water levels is more difficult than it sounds.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Take, for example, historical water-level data from the Buchanan Reservoir (shown below). While there are predictable short-term trends corresponding to regular fill and drain cycles, there are also longer-term, unpredictable fluctuations corresponding to drought conditions. Without a detailed understanding of the relationship between climate, water use, and management strategies, it is difficult to predict reservoir levels with much accuracy.</p>

        <h3>California's reservoirs form a network that spans the state. To predict future reservoir levels, we must understand how this network is affected by extreme climate events.</h3></div>
</div>
<div class="article-main">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To tackle the problem of predicting water levels, a team of Caltech researchers led by graduate student Armeen Taeb developed a novel statistical model of reservoirs. They used a technique called graphical modeling to combine statewide reservoir and climate data to make predictions. This network-based approach outperformed previous techniques that modeled individual reservoirs in isolation.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To predict the effects of drought, scientists first must be able to measure its severity. Because many different factors (e.g. soil dryness, temperature, and snowpack) can contribute to water scarcity, no one measurement tells the whole story. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was developed to address this by combining a wide variety of climate attributes into a single number.  <a href="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/palmer-drought-severity-index-pdsi">The typical PDSI scale ranges from -5 to +5</a>, where negative values indicate dry spells and positive values indicate wet spells.</p>
    <!--      PDSI Slider visualization  -->
    <div id="PDSI-viz" class="viz">
        <h2>The PDSI Scale</h2>

            <p id="p-extreme-wet">Extreme wet spell</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As of Summer 2018, California’s statewide PDSI value was <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/">-2</a>. This was a significant improvement since 2015, when California had a statewide PDSI value of <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/">-4</a> (indicating severe drought).   At the time, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency and created the Drought Task Force to organize the state’s response; they imposed a blanket mandate to <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2014/01/17/news18368/">reduce water usage by 25%</a>. </p>
        
   <p>&emsp;&emsp; PDSI is highly correlated with reservoir exhaustion: when PDSI drops, water levels tend to drop as well. Taeb’s work found that PDSI is the external factor that is most predictive of reservoir levels.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This, however, does not tell the whole story. It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"--that is, there is a high correlation between the water levels of certain pairs of reservoirs.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This connection can happen for either direct or indirect reasons. Sometimes one reservoir's level influences another's because they are physically connected (e.g. by a river). In other cases, two reservoirs may share similar geography or water management practices, so they behave alike. Taeb and his colleagues found that accounting for both types of relationships is essential for making accurate predictions of the reservoir system as a whole.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;By modeling the statewide reservoir network, they discovered that many water resources that are managed by independent bodies are in fact highly correlated with each other. This means that each district’s management policy could have an impact on neighboring regions. For example, in the above graphic we a single reservoir that feeds into two others. Any restriction on use in the first reservoir could also affect water availability in the two dependent areas. Discovering these connections could help water managers coordinate their strategies to ensure that everyone has access to the water they need.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Taeb’s model can also help policy makers identify clusters of reservoirs that are at high risk of being simultaneously exhausted. By knowing these at-risk areas in advance, water managers can release water more conservatively and minimize the chance of severe water restrictions in the future.</p>
