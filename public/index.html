        <h1>A Mathematical Route to Fighting Drought</h1>
        <h3>The recent California drought put many communities at critical risk of running out of water. Researchers at Caltech and JPL have developed powerful new statistical tools to predict reservoir levels and mitigate the impact of drought on California's water supply.
        </h3>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="article-main">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For four years, from 2012 to 2015, California was in a state of severe drought on par with the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014GL062433">worst periods in the past 1,200 years</a>. The impact of the drought was exacerbated by a fundamental limitation in our ability to predict water levels in reservoirs. Which reservoir will dry up first? How will the strain on that reservoir spread and affect nearby districts? Answering these sorts of questions would enable policy makers and water managers to mitigate the damage caused to California’s 40 million residents.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To get a sense of the extent of this damage, it helps to look at some numbers. In 2015 alone, the agriculture industry lost $1.84 billion in revenue due to the drought, totalling to <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/drought-costs-california-agriculture-184b-and-10100-jobs-2015/">$2.74 billion</a> across all economic sectors that year. This put more than <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/drought-costs-california-agriculture-184b-and-10100-jobs-2015/">10,000 seasonal laborers</a> out of work. Drought-related changes in ecology caused the coho salmon to face <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/calif-drought-could-wipe-out-southernmost-coho-salmon-group/">near-extinction</a>, and more than <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-sierra-tree-mortality-20161129-story.html">102 million trees</a> in the state died off. While this is far from a comprehensive list, it demonstrates how the effects of drought can ripple through both the environment and the economy.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Though there will always be costs associated with drought, they can be significantly reduced if more accurate water-level predictions are available. To this end, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are developing data-driven statistical models of California’s reservoir system. This work could help California achieve a more resilient water infrastructure and predict the impact of drought on water reservoirs months beyond our best current efforts. To understand the impact of their research, it is important to get an understanding of where California’s water comes and how it is affected by drought.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;California’s water comes from two main sources, groundwater and surface water. Groundwater, such as wells and aquifers, accounts for 60% of the total supply. Surface water, stored by <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Water_in_California.html?id=0EUyvzGk53UC">1,530 reservoirs across the state</a>, accounts for the other 40%. Reservoirs are actively managed bodies of surface water that provide for agriculture, industry, power generation, and recreational needs. While larger cities have diverse water resources such as multiple rivers and reservoirs, some smaller cities are limited to a single, local reservoir for water. While all reservoirs are affected by drought, not all are affected the same way.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The visualization below demonstrates the historical response of representative California reservoirs to a range of drought conditions. Try dragging the timeline slider to wet spells (blue regions) and dry spells (orange regions) to see how the reservoirs responded.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Reservoirs constantly undergo significant fluctuations in fill level. Every day, water managers decide how much water to release, and must find a balance between meeting current demand and planning for the future. To do this, they must consider timescales ranging from daily human use to multi-year climate trends. This is already a complex task, and an unexpected drought can make reservoir exhaustion difficult to avoid. When a reservoir runs out of water, communities that depend on its supply experience immediate and serious consequences.</p>

        <h1>Running Out in a Drought</h1>
        <p>The small community of Montague, California faced severe water restrictions when their local reservoir was near exhaustion.</p>
    </div>
</div>   
<div class="article-main">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In August 2014, the water level in Northern California’s Lake Shastina reservoir dropped to critical levels. This resulted in serious water restrictions in the nearby town of Montague, <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/20683/drought-stricken-california-town-struggles-to-keep-the-water-flowing">affecting its 1,500 residents</a>. Due to a shortage of water, each household in Montague was limited to 5,000 gallons of water a month, above which they would face a fine.</p>

    <hr>
    <p class="slide1-info" id="intro-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;In the visualization below - we will see one example of what 5,000 gallons of water can mean for a typical family. Each blue block represents a 20 gallon bucket, with the total representing the 5,000 limit imposed by the city. For each type of water consumption, the monthly usage is subtracted from the total. For these calculations, we have used the average Montague household size of 2.5 people (2010 US Census.) The consumption numbers come from a water-use calculator by the Southwest Florida Water Management district.</p>
    <p id="slide-1-2" class="slide1-info">A 10-minute shower per day, per person: 2,800 gallons.</p>
    <p id="slide-1-3" class="slide1-info">5 minutes running water per day, per person: 1,400 gallons.</p>
    <p id="slide-1-4" class="slide1-info">Two toilet flushes per day, per person: 560 gallons.</p>
    <p id="slide-1-5" class="slide1-info">One load of dishes and laundry per week: 224 gallons.</p>
    </div>   
    <p id="montague-wrapup">&emsp;&emsp;As we can see, the average household could easily consume 5,000 gallons in a month, even if they restrict water use to their basic needs. A family of three or more would almost surely exceed the limit and end up paying fines. The story of Montague demonstrates that communities face consequences when a reservoir reaches critically low levels. If it were possible to predict a reservoir’s water level months in advance, we could potentially mitigate the risk of reservoir exhaustion. Unfortunately, predicting future water levels is more difficult than it sounds.</p>
    <p>Take, for example, data from the Buchanan Reservoir. Below, we see historical water levels from 2003-2017. While there are predictable short-term trends corresponding to regular fill and drain cycles, there are also longer-term, unpredictable fluctuations corresponding to drought conditions. Without a detailed understanding of the relationship between climate, water use, and management strategies, it is difficult to predict reservoir levels with much accuracy.</p>

        <p id="buch-1" class="stat-info">&emsp;&emsp;In May 2013, the fill season was over, and the managers of the Buchanan Reservoir had to make prediction about water availability in the coming months.</p>
        
        <p id="buch-2" class="stat-info">&emsp;&emsp;Even though the water managers were likely using the best tools available to them, they were unable to prevent exhaustion of the Buchanan Reservoir. Better predictive tools may have extended the lifetime of the water supply.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p id="buch-wrapup">&emsp;&emsp;To that end, a team of Caltech researchers led by graduate student Armeen Taeb developed a novel statistical model to tackle the problem of predicting water levels. They used a technique called graphical modeling to combine statewide reservoir and climate data to make predictions that outperformed other techniques based on modeling individual reservoirs in isolation.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For them to predict the effects of drought, it was necessary to quantify its severity. However, scientists cannot rely on any single measurement because many different factors (e.g. soil dryness, temperature, and snowpack) can contribute to water scarcity. As a way to address this, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was developed as a hydrological measure that combines a wide variety of climate attributes into a single number.  <a href="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/palmer-drought-severity-index-pdsi">PDSI ranges from -5 to +5</a>, where negative values indicate dry spells and positive values indicate wet spells.</p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As of Summer 2018, California’s statewide PDSI value was <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/">-2</a>.This was a significant improvement since 2015, when California had a statewide PDSI value of <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/historical-palmers/">-4</a>.   At the time, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency and created the Drought Task Force to organize the state’s response; they imposed a blanket mandate to <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2014/01/17/news18368/">reduce water usage by 25%</a>. Taeb’s work found that PDSI is the single most predictive external factor. PDSI on its own is a powerful tool for predicting risk of reservoir exhaustion.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This, however, does not tell the whole story. It turns out that reservoirs are "connected"-- that is, there is a high correlation between the water levels of some pairs of reservoirs. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons (such as a physically connection) but sometimes there are statistical correlations (for example, from similar geography and water management). Taeb and his colleagues found that accounting for this connectivity is essential for making accurate predictions of the reservoir system as a whole.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;By modeling the statewide reservoir network, they discovered that many water resources that are managed by independent bodies are in fact highly correlated with each other. This means that each district’s management policy could have an impact on neighboring regions. For example, in the above graphic we a single reservoir that feeds into two others. Any restriction on use in the first reservoir could also affect water availability in the two dependent areas. Discovering these connections could help water managers coordinate their strategies to ensure that everyone has access to the water they need.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Taeb’s model can also help policy makers identify clusters of reservoirs that are at high risk of being simultaneously exhausted. By knowing these high-risk areas in advance, water managers can adjust how conservatively they release water and minimize the chance of severe water restrictions in the future.</p>

        <p id="stat-3" class="stat-info">&emsp;&emsp;As conditions worsen, the effect of drought propagates to other reservoirs based on their interconnectivity. Much like in a rolling blackout, independently managed reservoir may face correlated risk of failure if these connections are not accounted for.</p>

    <p id="wrapup">&emsp;&emsp;Drought will always be an issue for California, and will only be exacerbated by a growing population and the imminent consequences of climate change. While we cannot control the weather, we can control how we react to it. If California can combine smart conservation measures with a more resilient water infrastructure, it may be possible to manage the negative impacts of drought so that we never have to face the worst-case scenario of total reservoir exhaustion.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;By using accurate statistical models of water systems, policy makers can design statewide strategies that will prevent California from suffering severe water rationing and restrictions. This work from Caltech and JPL shows that scientific research and public policy can go hand in hand to build a more resilient California.</p>
